# 🔬 Stranger Sections 2

<img src='assets/stranger-sections-2.png'>

The challenge is focused on the micrometer scale analysis of geosciences, specifically targeting the segmentation and classification of kerogen macerals in thin section images of rocks. Participants are provided with labeled training data to develop machine learning models capable of identifying three types of kerogen: liptinite, vitrinite, and inertinite. These models must segment and classify the kerogens based on their unique characteristics under reflected light microscopy. The challenge includes a test set for evaluation and additional unlabeled images for further model training or testing. The primary evaluation metric is the Jaccard Score, rewarding models that accurately segment and classify the kerogen types, which is crucial for understanding sedimentary rocks and searching for new hydrocarbon reserves.
